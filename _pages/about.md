Hello world! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of California, Los Angeles and student affiliate at the [California Center for Population Research](https://ccpr.ucla.edu).

My research interests are in urban economics, with particular interests in transportation, migration, and labor economics. In my research I use large data sets with spatial information to explore how household migration and travel decisions influence inequalities in economic, political, and other outcomes. I am also passionate about causal inference and love to exploit clever natural experiments to learn about people and cities.

I am currently studying how e-commerce changes household travel patterns within cities and what this means for citywide traffic, neighborhood quality, and household location choices. I am also working on projects to understand the determinants of migration and commuting patterns which shape the distribution of households across space.
